    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These impressive Cape Cod cocktail meatballs are perfect for Christmas, New Year's, or any celebration. This is
        my version, but the recipe originated in Cape Cod (cranberry country).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce (such as Ocean Spray)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups ketchup</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, parsley, onion, soy sauce, and garlic powder in a bowl until
            thoroughly mixed. </li>
        <li> Roll meat mixture into meatballs using about 2 teaspoons meat mixture per meatball; arrange meatballs in a
            large, deep baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are browned, about 25 minutes. Drain excess grease. </li>
        <li>Combine cranberry sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir
            until cranberry sauce melts and sugar dissolves. Pour sauce over meatballs. </li>
        <li>Continue baking in the oven until sauce forms a glaze and meatballs are no longer pink inside, 25 to 30
            minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy! </li>

    </ol>
